### About Me:

My name is Martynas Žitkevičius, I am 25 years old. From an early age, I found myself as a very curious person who likes to observe and analyze everything around me. I always liked to observe situations, people, their behavior, problems, analyze and find the best possible solutions.

After a while, I decided to fulfill my personal analytical, critical thinking strengths, abilities and get deeper into computer science. I decided to learn coding and become a professional Front-End developer. It is a long way ahead, but the exciting and interesting one. I do like challenges, they encourage me to concentrate, think more, reveal professional growth potential, and, of course, help me gain more knowledge and experience.

I am still in the learning process, I attend online coding courses, read books, articles about current main programming, website building principles, trends, and the upcoming ones.
